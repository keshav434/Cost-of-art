Programming Languages:

C#: Understanding of C# syntax, structure, and conventions.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Class Design: Creating abstract classes and concrete classes for shapes.
Inheritance: Utilizing inheritance to define common properties and methods for different shapes.
Polymorphism: Implementing methods that can work with objects of different shapes.
File I/O Operations:

Reading Files: Reading painting and paint shop files in different formats (CSV and TXT).
Writing Files: Potentially saving edited paintings back to a file.
String Manipulation:

Parsing Strings: Extracting and validating data from strings, particularly when reading file content.
String Methods: Using methods like Trim, Split, and Contains to process input.
Validation:

Input Validation: Ensuring user inputs and file contents meet specific criteria (e.g., valid colors, dimensions within range).
Error Handling: Gracefully handling invalid inputs and providing meaningful feedback to the user.
Console Applications:

User Interface Design: Designing a text-based user interface with menus and prompts.
User Interaction: Capturing and responding to user input through the console.
Data Structures:

Lists and Arrays: Managing collections of shapes and files using lists and arrays.
Mathematical Calculations:

Geometry: Calculating areas of different shapes.
Unit Conversion: Converting paint coverage and cost calculations to provide accurate quotes.
Algorithm Design:

Sorting: Sorting paints by price to provide cost-effective options.
Searching: Finding specific files or shapes within collections.
Debugging and Testing:

Testing Validation Rules: Creating test cases to ensure validation rules are correctly implemented.
Troubleshooting: Debugging issues related to file parsing and user input handling.
Attention to Detail:

Accuracy: Ensuring calculations for paint coverage and cost are accurate.
Format Adherence: Strictly following the specified format for file content and console output.
Software Design Principles:

Modularity: Designing the application in a modular way to separate concerns (e.g., separate methods for creating shapes, parsing files, and handling user input).
Maintainability: Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.# Cost-of-art
